# Garden Environment Sensor

An ESP32-based sensor system to remotely monitor temperature, humidity, light levels, and soil moisture in your garden or greenhouse.

> ⚠️ This project is intended for local network use. If exposing it to the public internet, consider adding authentication and HTTPS.

## Features

### Lightweight API
- `POST /api/sensor` — accepts JSON sensor payloads  
- `GET /api/status` — returns basic system status  
- `GET /api/history` — returns historical data from `sensorlog.csv`

### OTA Update Support
- Wirelessly update the firmware using Arduino IDE (PlatformIO support in progress)
- It shows up as a wireless device, just select it and upload your changes

### Wireless Monitoring via Web Dashboard
- Flask/Gunicorn or FastAPI backend
- Displays real-time sensor data and historical charts
- Supports trend tracking, average calculations, and more

### Frontend
- Dashboard built using Jinja2, run with Gunicorn
- Displays a clean, interactive chart powered by [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/)
- Dual Y-axis chart
- Customizable with basic HTML + CSS in `/templates/dashboard.html` and `/static/style.css`

### Live or Periodic Updates
- Real-time updates via HTTP POST or MQTT subscription
- Periodic logging to `raw_sensorlog.csv`
- Utility script `data-cleaner.py` included to clean and validate data, saved as `cleaned_sensorlog.csv`

### Multi-Network Support
- Automatically connects to known Wi-Fi networks
- Easily configurable for multiple locations

### MQTT / Home Assistant Integration
- `flask-mqtt` used to send sensor information to `garden/sensors`
- Easily integrate with Home Assistant to create graphs using `mini-graph-card`

## Installation & Setup

This guide is assuming you have basic coding/folder structure/terminal knowledge, are familiar with VScode, and know how to wire I2C components to microcontrollers. This is not a full tutorial designed for beginners, however if you have any questions at all please don't hesitate to reach out, and I'll do my best to help you get up and running.

### Requirements

- ESP32 Dev Board  
- Raspberry Pi Zero W (or any device to run Flask/FastAPI server)  
- VSCode with PlatformIO extension installed  

#### Sensors:
- HDC1080 – I2C, Temperature & Humidity (Adafruit)
- OPT3001 – I2C, Precision light sensor (TI)  
- VH400 - Analog soil moisture sensor (Vegetronix)

### Uploading ESP32 Firmware

1. Open VSCode and install the **PlatformIO** extension if not already installed.
2. Navigate to `esp32-firmware/src/main.cpp` and update the Wi-Fi credentials:
   - Edit the Wi-Fi SSID and password definitions at the top and in the fallback section.

3. Plug in your ESP32 board and confirm the COM port in PlatformIO.

4. Open a terminal and navigate to the firmware folder:

```bash
cd esp32-firmware
```

5. Build the code:

```bash
platformio run
```

6. Upload the firmware:

```bash
platformio run --target upload
```

7. Open the serial monitor to get the device's IP address:

```bash
platformio device monitor --baud 115200
```

If you see unreadable characters, confirm the baud rate or press the reset button on the ESP32.

## Running the Web Server

Navigate to the `/dashboard` directory. You'll find two folders:

- `/flask` — lightweight and ideal for devices like the RPi Zero W  
- `/fastapi` — async, scalable, and better for higher performance systems

### Flask with Gunicorn (Basic launch)
```bash
cd garden-dev/dashboard/flask
gunicorn -b 0.0.0.0:8000 dashboard:app
```
 > Note: `dashboard:app` tells Gunicorn to look for the Flask app object named `app` in the `dashboard.py` file.
### Flask with Gunicorn (Using gunicorn.conf.py)
```bash
cd garden-dev/dashboard/flask
gunicorn -c gunicorn.conf.py dashboard:app
```

### FastAPI
```bash
cd dashboard/fastapi
uvicorn fastapi:app --reload
```

Once the server is running, visit it in your browser:

```
http://<IP_ADDRESS>:8000/dashboard
```

Replace `<IP_ADDRESS>` with the IP of the device hosting the server.

---

## Troubleshooting

- Ensure both ESP32 and server device are on the same network.
- Restart the server if you modify Flask/FastAPI code.
- Verify sensor wiring and I2C addresses if values are not appearing.

## Customizing the Dashboard UI

The web interface is built with simple HTML, CSS, and Chart.js. You'll find these files in the appropriate server folder:

```
dashboard/
├── flask-dashboard/
│   ├── templates/
│   │   └── dashboard.html   - Main HTML template
│   └── static/
│       └── style.css        - CSS styling
│       └── chart.min.js     - Chart.js library
```

To modify the UI:
- **Edit `dashboard.html`** to change layout, add labels, or display more data.
- **Update `style.css`** to customize colors, fonts, spacing, etc.
- **Replace or extend `chart.min.js`** logic in the script section to add more chart types or interactions.

Feel free to rework the template to match your branding or expand it into a full progressive web app (PWA) down the line.
